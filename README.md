&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Nice work on Milestone 1. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. Everything looks great here, just a couple of tiny issues with your HTML. See below. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

#### Edits/Suggestions
- Your HTML code looks really good overall. The only style suggestion I have is not to include the main body text within a &lt;header&gt; tag. The &lt;header&gt; tag should just house things like the logo, main navigation, etc.
- In milestone-1.php and usecase.php, the closing &lt;/html&gt; tag is missing.
