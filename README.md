### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Nice work on Milestone 1. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. Everything looks great here, just a couple of tiny issues with your HTML. See below. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

#### Edits/Suggestions
- Your HTML code looks really good overall. The only style suggestion I have is not to include the main body text within a &lt;header&gt; tag. The &lt;header&gt; tag should just house things like the logo, main navigation, etc.
- In milestone-1.php and usecase.php, the closing &lt;/html&gt; tag is missing.

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10004; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10004; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

Milestone 2&alpha; looks good! Go ahead and start coding. I still see a minor issue with your HTML, detailed below. Since you want to have a portfolio with images, I'd recommend taking a look at [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) for your gallery.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your code structure is great, but you seem to be using `<p>` tags where you should be using `<div>` tags. `<p>` tags are for paragraphs of text, while `<div>` tags are containers for other elements.
